# BatoceraSquashfs.Maker
Helps You make a .wsquashfs  for Wine in batocera.linux. 

There are 2 Options.

Wsquashfs: for Batocera Windows games.

regualar squashfs: just a Normal squashfs.

## Filesystem setup [For Batocera]:
to set it up you must position and name the files like this:

  -------------
  |Update[Folder]
  |
  |build.sh[Script]
  -------------

  ## Filesystem setup for Regualar squashfs [Linux]:
  Again, It has to be in the same layout as this:

    -------------
  |   makesquash
  |
  |   build.sh
  -------------

  That is all. if you need help, feel free to put it into issues. Enjoy :)
